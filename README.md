Q2  Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects 

Scope

An android application should be developed to help people who suffer from disabling hearing loss Around 5% of the world population suffers from this problem. This application will alert the user in critical situations where immediate alertness is required like to notice vehicles when crossing the road, when someone is crying for help, etc. The Mobile application uses Artificial Intelligence to detect some common sounds in these situations like vehicle hom, etc 

Features:

• This Mobile application should use Artificial intelligence to detect sounds • The App should alert the users when it recognizes the sounds of critical situations

The predictions of the Mobile Application should be very accurate latency

The App should consume less power and should have little The App should take some response from the user when a critical situation is detected

to ensure that the user has been alerted Notify friends and family in case when no response from the user when a critical situation is detected.

Non-functional aspects:

The App should alert the user through some vibrations The latericy of the app should be less than 2 seconds The users should be able to add additional sounds which have to be recognized by the

The app should be able to track the live location of users that can be sent to friends and family in emergency situations

The app should be able to suggest the routes to be taken while traveling where there is less traffic available
